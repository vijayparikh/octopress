Phil Rhodes asks an [interesting question](https://www.redsharknews.com/production/item/6931-why-can-t-we-just-have-one-lens-mount) - why can't we have one universal mount?

{% blockquote Phil Rhodes https://www.redsharknews.com/production/item/6931-why-can-t-we-just-have-one-lens-mount WHY CAN'T WE JUST HAVE ONE LENS MOUNT? %}
Wouldn't it be amazing if there was only one lens mount? But even if it is technically possible, there are reasons why it wouldn't, and possibly shouldn't happen.

One lens mount to rule them all? It can be a large source of frustration when choosing a new camera. Which lens mount do you go for? And the big question that always arrises is, why can't we just have one common mounting system?

Probably the biggest reasons there arenâ€™t more commonality in lens mounts are commercial and political, but those are human factors. We could, in theory, change them. But is it technically possible?

Until now, his hypothesis has been the general consensus. All of the major mounts - Fuji X mount, Canon EF, Nikon F and Sony E in the 35mm segment - have been proprietary to each company.  These are due to one or all of the following: history, proprietary technology, market protection.  The more important question is if it is even possible.  Most people would say that without general cooperation between all of the vendors, which for the above stated reasons, is highly unlikely.  

The rise of mirror less interchangeable lens cameras, the rules are changing. First out of the gate was the Micro 4/3rds system.  This was an excellent middle of the road - and an honest attempt to create the universal mount. The M43 mount is an open standard, and theoretically, any company has access to the mount.  And indeed the M43 ecosystem has a widest adaptation of third party lens suppliers. Olympus and Panasonic being the largest.

But the M43 standard was a compromise - in both sensor size and resolution - in favor of smaller cameras and lenses. The big bet by the M43 consortium was that they can innovate with features and that having a smaller sensor would allow them to have a substantial cost advantage.  M43 manufactures, especially Olympus, did introduce many of the features we take for granted in MILC cameras. Sensor cleaning, IBIS, compact size, live video, etc. With Panasonic jumping on board with its Lumix line and dozens of lens manufactures jumping on board manufacturing lenses, it looked like M43 would be the new mass market standard.  

Until Sony came along.

Sony introduced the first full frame MILC system with the EF mount.  With Sony already making the lions share of the sensors that go into full frame cameras, they were able to drive the price down of full frame sensors - and full frame MILC to the point of being ***cheaper then the newest M43 bodies from Olympus and Panasonic***. This put an end to the hopes of M43 as mass market system. Olympus just announced that the are getting out of the camera business. Panasonic won't be too far behind.

This left Sony in the enviable position as the **only** full frame MILC system in the market. Sony was able to quickly gain market share and assume the dominant position for full frame mirrorless market for nearly 5 years.  Canon and Nikon during this time was in a wait and see mode.

But things are not as rosy as would seem in the Sony camp.  Their FE mount, just like the M43, is a compromise. Sony entered the camera market by purchasing Minolta. They entered the DSLR market using the Minolta A-mount system as their basis for their Alpha line of DSLR cameras.  Sony was successful entering the DSLR market agains Canon and Nikon - eventually gaining a 13% market share and becoming the third largest DSLR manufacturer.

Sony correctly surmised that they will not be able to gain substantially more market share in the DSLR market, and so switched to the MILC market. They invented the E mount for their APS-C mount camera system. The E mount was successful with an impressive market share in a very short time. But Sony had its sight set on the full frame market.

Sony had the once in a lifetime opportunity to design a mount from the ground up to be optimized for the full frame market.  But again, like the M43 standard, they compromised.  They shoe horned a full frame sensor into the E mount.  While the E mount had a short flange distance of 18mm, Sony kept the mount throat diameter. A concession to keep compatibility with the E mount lens.  And this will limit them, much the way the small F mount had limited Nikon.

Which leads us to Canon and Nikon. Both introduced a new full frame mirrorless mount specifically optimized for mirrorless.  Canon entered the market with the RF mount. While the RF mount has a short flange distance of 20mm, they kept the throat diameter of 54mm from the Canon EOS mount. The 54mm throat diameter has served Canon well but I can't shake the feeling that it was a missed opportunity.  Not like its limiting Canon in any way - they have released a bevy of impressive pro optics already.  Canon should be poised to be able to go head to with easily with Sony, and compete with the dark horse of the industry.

This brings us, finally, to the last major player in the full frame MILC market - Nikon. Nikon announced their Z mount to much fanfare. But the first bodies that they released - the Z6/Z7 - left much to be desired.  But again, they are the first generation. But many people missed the mark - the true gem for Nikon is the **Z mount**.

Nikon did it right - they spent the time to throw away the old and re-engineer for the future.  They came out with a mount that has the shortest flange distance of 16mm and the largest throat diameter of 55mm. So whats the big deal you say? Here is the official video explanation from Nikon:
