The first trailer for the Pete Souza documentary [The Way I See It](https://www.focusfeatures.com/the-way-i-see-it). The movie follows the former White House Photographer for both Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama into a “searing commentator” on the state of US politics, all through the power of his photographs.
