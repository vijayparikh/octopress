I bought a new tripod.  After a lot of research, and deciding what criteria was important to me, I settled on the [Peak Design Travel Tripod](https://amzn.to/3oiefj6).

Yes its the carbon fiber. And yes its costs $600.  

You read that right. And just like yours, I almost had a heart attack when I saw that price tag. And I felt sick hitting the buy button, but in my short time of using it - it is so worth it.  

I know. I know. You are thinking I started drinking the cool-aid.  But there are reasons why this is worth this much money.  Here is Peak Design's explanation:

So, what goes into the price tag of a $600 travel tripod? More parts, smaller parts, harder to make parts, harder to assemble and inspect parts. A smaller size, equal performance, extra functionality, and delightful user experience. A tripod made by fairly paid workers in safe conditions. A tripod that is made, assembled, and shipped with zero net carbon emissions. A tripod guaranteed for life.

Thats Peak Design's justification/marketing/sales pitch.  Are they right? Stay tuned, I will be writing up my use cases and why I haven't completely lost my mind :)
